					What is HPV?
				</h3>
				<p>
					HPV is an STD spread via contact with infected skin. It can cause increased rates of various forms of cancer, such as cervical, penile, and other forms of gential cancer. There are a number of subtypes, and the ones that cause cancers are known as "high-risk" sub-types.

					How Can I Avoid HPV?
				</h3>
				<p>
					HPV can be avoided by similar methods as other STD's, such as usage of condoms, dental dams, and avoiding using non-sterilized syringes. Make sure to get tested often, and recieve the HPV vaccine. There currently are vaccines for a number of forms of HPV, including 16 and 18, 2 of the highest risk forms.

					Who Has HPV?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Anyone can be infected with HPV, but prevalence rates of high-risk sub-types are heightened in African-American women. 80% of sexually active people are or will be infected at some point in their lives. Currently approximately 79 million Americans are infected with HPV, with roughly 14 million people becoming infected each year.

					What Does HPV Do?
				</h3>
				<p>
					HPV is characterized by causing warts and soreness on infected areas, along with other bumpy skin. However, these are only signs of "low-risk" forms of HPV, and "high-risk", or oncogenic, forms, often cannot be detected before cancer or other cellular abnormalities have been caused. Often, low-risk forms are defeated by one's immune system before warts even appear.
